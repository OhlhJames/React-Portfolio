# React Portfolio

# Description
            
This is my personal portfolio powered by React! This project allows perspective eployers to view my projects, skills, and proficiencies so that they can decide whether or not I am a good fit for the company as well as offering me the opportunity to stand out amongst other candidates by giving them a site I have built as way to truly showcase my talent
