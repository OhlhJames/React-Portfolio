            Hello! My name is James Ohlhausen and I and a soon to be graduate from the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at UT in Austin, Texas.
            I started my coding roots in highschool where I was the captain of the UIL Computer Science Team in Junior and Senior year.
            I learned basic JavaScript skills with functions and debugging as well as learned a good amount about how code is read as well as how the Stack operates.
            I am mostly experienced in JavaScript, HTML, CSS for my base languages but I have also dabbled in Python for some small personal projects.
